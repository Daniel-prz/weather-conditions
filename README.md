class Weather, with a constructorr with temperature, precipitation,  
and description as parameters, allows us to seamlessly objects each with  
'temperature', 'precipitation', and 'description' as properties.  
It also contains methods to easily change each property of an object after creation,  
and also a method to display the created object to the console

![DayWeather](<Screenshot 2024-02-24 135522.png>)
class DayWeather 'extends' class Weather, retaining the previous class constructor parameters,  
and also allowing us to remove or add new parameters as needed.
